The data sources will be created by me in an excel sheet and exported to csv files. These will be
accessed by the seeds.rb file and added to the database using models with preexisting associations.

The data will be a mockup of a vet system with 6 tables in total, two of which will be to join
many-to-many relationships. The tables will include Cats, Dogs, Owners, and Vets.

Vets have a one-to-many association with owners (One vet, many owners). Cats and Dogs have many-to-
many relationships with Owners (An owner may have more than one pet, pets may have more than one owner).
These many-to-many associations will be fixed with joiner tables, Cat_Ownership and Dog_Ownership.



Cats and Dogs will have their age and breed as columns. Owners will have their name and address as columns.
Vets will have their last and location as columns.
Cat and Dog Ownership will include the ids of the cat/dog and their owner.
Every table will have a unique id labelled id.
